Title: About Me

I'm Cameron Brower, an Infrastructure Engineer by day and a devoted hobbiest the of rest the time. I live in Austin, Texas with my fianc√© and my kitty. 

I love Linux, software engineering, CI/CD, and Kubernetes. I am interested in robotics, quadrocopters, mechanical keyboards, and home automation.
